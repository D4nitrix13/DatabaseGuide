### ***Ejemplo Práctico***

**Vamos a crear dos tablas simples y realizar un `CROSS JOIN` entre ellas.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Colores (
    NameColor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Tamaños (
    Valor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Colores (NameColor)
VALUES ('Rojo'), ('Verde'), ('Azul');

INSERT INTO Tamaños (Valor)
VALUES ('Chico'), ('Mediano'), ('Grande');
```

```sql
sqlite> CREATE TABLE Colores (
    NameColor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Tamaños (
    Valor VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Colores (NameColor)
VALUES ('Rojo'), ('Verde'), ('Azul');

INSERT INTO Tamaños (Valor)
VALUES ('Chico'), ('Mediano'), ('Grande');
```

- **Ahora, realizamos un `CROSS JOIN`:**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Colores c 
CROSS JOIN Tamaños t 
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * 
FROM Colores c 
CROSS JOIN Tamaños t 
LIMIT 100;
Rojo|Chico
Rojo|Mediano
Rojo|Grande
Verde|Chico
Verde|Mediano
Verde|Grande
Azul|Chico
Azul|Mediano
Azul|Grande
```

---

### ***Salida***

| *NameColor* | *Valor*   |
| ----------- | --------- |
| *Rojo*      | *Chico*   |
| *Rojo*      | *Mediano* |
| *Rojo*      | *Grande*  |
| *Verde*     | *Chico*   |
| *Verde*     | *Mediano* |
| *Verde*     | *Grande*  |
| *Azul*      | *Chico*   |
| *Azul*      | *Mediano* |
| *Azul*      | *Grande*  |

---

### ***Pregunta: ¿Por qué no veo el uso de `AS` o corchetes `[]` en esta consulta?***

- **En SQL, no es obligatorio usar el alias de tabla con `AS`, puedes simplemente escribir el alias sin necesidad de la palabra clave. Por ejemplo:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Colores c CROSS JOIN Tamaños t;
```

- *Aquí, `c` y `t` son alias para las tablas `Colores` y `Tamaños`, respectivamente. También, los corchetes `[]` son específicos de ciertos dialectos de SQL (como SQL Server) y no siempre son necesarios. En otros sistemas como SQLite, PostgreSQL, y MySQL, el uso de comillas dobles `" "` para nombres de columnas o tablas funciona igual.*

*![Image CrossJoin](/Images/ImageCrossJoin.png "/Images/ImageCrossJoin.png")*
*![Image CrossJoinQuery](/Images/ImageCrossJoinQuery.png "/Images/ImageCrossJoinQuery.png")*

---

### ***Joins:***

*En SQL, los **Joins** permiten combinar filas de dos o más tablas en función de una relación común entre ellas. En resumen:*

- *Sin `WHERE`, es un **Cross Join** (producto cartesiano).*
- *Con `WHERE`, se convierte en un **Inner Join** implícito.*

**Ejemplo:**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM "Employees" e
INNER JOIN "Orders" o
ON e."EmployeeID" = o."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * 
FROM "Employees" e
INNER JOIN "Orders" o
ON e."EmployeeID" = o."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;

## ***Ejemplo práctico: Creación de tabla y explicación de cada paso***

- **Creamos una nueva tabla `Rewards` que guarda recompensas asociadas a empleados:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE "Rewards" (
    "RewardsID" INTEGER NOT NULL,
    "EmployeeID" INTEGER,
    "Reward" TEXT,
    "Month" TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY("RewardsID" AUTOINCREMENT)
);
```

**Esta estructura define:**

- **RewardsID:** *Identificador único para cada recompensa.*
- **EmployeeID:** *Identificador del empleado que recibe la recompensa, vinculable a la tabla `Employees`.*
- **Reward:** *Valor de la recompensa.*
- **Month:** *Mes en el que se otorgó la recompensa.*
  
**Insertamos algunos datos:**

```sql
INSERT INTO "Rewards" ("EmployeeID", "Reward", "Month")
VALUES 
    (3, 200, "January"),
    (2, 180, "February"),
    (5, 250, "March"),
    (1, 280, "April"),
    (8, 160, "May"),
    (NULL, NULL, "June");
```

---

### ***INNER JOIN***

*El **Inner Join** devuelve las filas que tienen coincidencias en ambas tablas:*

```sql
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
INNER JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
INNER JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
LIMIT 100;
Janet|200|January
Andrew|180|February
Steven|250|March
Nancy|280|April
Laura|160|May
```

---

#### ***Salida (Output)***

| *FirstName* | *Reward* | *Month*    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| *Janet*     | *200*    | *January*  |
| *Andrew*    | *180*    | *February* |
| *Steven*    | *250*    | *March*    |
| *Nancy*     | *280*    | *April*    |
| *Laura*     | *160*    | *May*      |

**En este caso:**

- **Tabla A:** *`Employees` (`e`).*
- **Tabla B:** *`Rewards` (`r`).*

*El `INNER JOIN` solo muestra filas cuando `EmployeeID` coincide en ambas tablas.*

---

### ***LEFT JOIN***

- *Un **Left Join** devuelve todas las filas de la tabla izquierda (`Employees`), y las filas coincidentes de la tabla derecha (`Rewards`):*

```sql
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
LEFT JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
LEFT JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;
Nancy|280|April
Andrew|180|February
Janet|200|January
Margaret||
Steven|250|March
Michael||
Robert||
Laura|160|May
Anne||
Adam||
```

---

#### ***Salida:***

| *FirstName* | *Reward* | *Month*    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| *Nancy*     | *280*    | *April*    |
| *Andrew*    | *180*    | *February* |
| *Janet*     | *200*    | *January*  |
| *Margaret*  | *NULL*   | *NULL*     |
| *Steven*    | *250*    | *March*    |
| *Michael*   | *NULL*   | *NULL*     |
| *Robert*    | *NULL*   | *NULL*     |
| *Laura*     | *160*    | *May*      |
| *Anne*      | *NULL*   | *NULL*     |
| *Adam*      | *NULL*   | *NULL*     |

- **Aquí:**

- **Tabla A:** *`Employees` (`e`).*
- **Tabla B:** *`Rewards` (`r`).*

- *Las filas de `Employees` se muestran, y cuando no hay coincidencias en `Rewards`, las columnas `Reward` y `Month` contienen `NULL`.*

---

### ***RIGHT JOIN***

- *SQLite no admite **Right Join**. Como alternativa, invertimos las tablas y usamos `LEFT JOIN`:*

```sql
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Rewards" r
LEFT JOIN "Employees" e
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Rewards" r
LEFT JOIN "Employees" e
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID" 
LIMIT 100;
Janet|200|January
Andrew|180|February
Steven|250|March
Nancy|280|April
Laura|160|May
||June
```

---

### ***FULL OUTER JOIN***

- *SQLite tampoco admite **Full Outer Join** directamente, pero se puede simular usando `UNION` para combinar los resultados de un `LEFT JOIN` y un `RIGHT JOIN`:*

```sql
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
LEFT JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
UNION
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Rewards" r
LEFT JOIN "Employees" e
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
LEFT JOIN "Rewards" r
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
UNION
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Rewards" r
LEFT JOIN "Employees" e
ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
LIMIT 100;
||June
Adam||
Andrew|180|February
Anne||
Janet|200|January
Laura|160|May
Margaret||
Michael||
Nancy|280|April
Robert||
Steven|250|March
```

### ***UNION en SQL***

- *El operador **UNION** combina los resultados de dos o más subconsultas en un solo conjunto de resultados. A diferencia de los Joins, que combinan tablas en función de una relación específica, **UNION** simplemente apila los resultados de múltiples consultas, siempre que estas tengan la misma estructura.*

*Para utilizar **UNION**, ambas subconsultas deben:*

1. *Tener el mismo número de columnas.*
2. *Tener tipos de datos compatibles en las columnas correspondientes.*

**Por ejemplo:**

```sql
SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Employees" e
LEFT JOIN "Rewards" r ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"

UNION

SELECT "FirstName", "Reward", "Month" 
FROM "Rewards" r
LEFT JOIN "Employees" e ON e."EmployeeID" = r."EmployeeID"
LIMIT 100;
```

---

#### ***Explicación***

- *Este ejemplo utiliza `UNION` para simular un **FULL OUTER JOIN** en SQLite, ya que esta base de datos no lo admite directamente. Aquí:*
- *La primera consulta (`LEFT JOIN` desde `Employees` hacia `Rewards`) devuelve todas las filas de `Employees` y las coincidencias en `Rewards`, mostrando `NULL` donde no hay coincidencias.*
- *La segunda consulta (`LEFT JOIN` desde `Rewards` hacia `Employees`) devuelve todas las filas de `Rewards` y las coincidencias en `Employees`, con `NULL` para los empleados que no tienen recompensa.*

---

### **¿Diferencias entre UNION y UNION ALL?**

- **UNION:** *Elimina duplicados en los resultados combinados.*
- **UNION ALL:** *Mantiene todos los resultados, incluso duplicados, mejorando el rendimiento al no filtrar resultados repetidos.*

---

### ***Ejemplo Práctico:***

- *Estructura para crear las tablas `StudentsA` y `StudentsB`, insertando algunos datos de ejemplo para que el operador `UNION` funcione según el ejemplo que mencionaste:*

```sql
-- Crear tabla StudentsA
CREATE TABLE "StudentsA" (
    "StudentID" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "StudentName" TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Crear tabla StudentsB
CREATE TABLE "StudentsB" (
    "StudentID" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "StudentName" TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Insertar datos en StudentsA
INSERT INTO "StudentsA" ("StudentName")
VALUES 
    ('Ana'),
    ('Luis'),
    ('Carlos'),
    ('María');

-- Insertar datos en StudentsB
INSERT INTO "StudentsB" ("StudentName")
VALUES 
    ('Carlos'),  -- Nombre duplicado para probar UNION
    ('Jorge'),
    ('Ana'),     -- Nombre duplicado para probar UNION
    ('Laura');

-- Ejecutar consulta UNION
SELECT "StudentName" 
FROM "StudentsA"

UNION

SELECT "StudentName" 
FROM "StudentsB";
```

```sql
sqlite> -- Crear tabla StudentsA
CREATE TABLE "StudentsA" (
    "StudentID" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "StudentName" TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Crear tabla StudentsB
CREATE TABLE "StudentsB" (
    "StudentID" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    "StudentName" TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Insertar datos en StudentsA
INSERT INTO "StudentsA" ("StudentName")
VALUES 
    ('Ana'),
    ('Luis'),
    ('Carlos'),
    ('María');

-- Insertar datos en StudentsB
INSERT INTO "StudentsB" ("StudentName")
VALUES 
    ('Carlos'),  -- Nombre duplicado para probar UNION
    ('Jorge'),
    ('Ana'),     -- Nombre duplicado para probar UNION
    ('Laura');

-- Ejecutar consulta UNION
SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsA UNION SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsB LIMIT 100
```

---

### ***Explicación de los Resultados***

- *La consulta `UNION` combinará los nombres de ambas tablas y eliminará duplicados. En este caso, los nombres "Ana" y "Carlos" solo aparecerán una vez en el resultado final, aunque están en ambas tablas.*

---

### ***Resultado Esperado***

| *StudentName* |
|---------------|
| *Ana*         |
| *Luis*        |
| *Carlos*      |
| *María*       |
| *Jorge*       |
| *Laura*       |

- *Este resultado muestra cómo **UNION** devuelve una lista unificada de nombres sin duplicados.*

- **Supongamos dos tablas, `StudentsA` y `StudentsB`, con estudiantes de dos clases distintas. Queremos obtener una lista de todos los estudiantes de ambas clases sin duplicados:**

### ***Bug en la extensión cweijan.vscode-mysql-client2 al ejecutar consultas SQL***

> [!CAUTION]
> *Se ha identificado un bug en la extensión **cweijan.vscode-mysql-client2** para Visual Studio Code al ejecutar consultas SQL que incluyen múltiples líneas o formato de comillas. En particular, la siguiente consulta falla al ejecutarse cuando se pega en el editor con comillas dobles y saltos de línea:*

```sql
SELECT "StudentName" 
FROM "StudentsA"

UNION

SELECT "StudentName" 
FROM "StudentsB";
```

- **La consulta arroja un error debido a los saltos de línea y las comillas dobles que envuelven los nombres de columnas y tablas.**

- *Sin embargo, el problema desaparece si la consulta se reescribe en una sola línea sin comillas dobles, de esta manera:*

```sql
SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsA UNION SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsB LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
sqlite> SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsA UNION SELECT StudentName FROM StudentsB LIMIT 100;
Ana
Carlos
Jorge
Laura
Luis
María
```

- **Solución temporal:** *Para evitar este error, se recomienda eliminar los saltos de línea y las comillas dobles, escribiendo las consultas en una sola línea siempre que sea posible hasta que el problema sea resuelto en una actualización de la extensión.*

- *Aquí, el operador `UNION` nos da una lista única de nombres de estudiantes. Usaríamos `UNION ALL` si deseamos ver duplicados (por ejemplo, si un estudiante aparece en ambas clases).*

### ***Conclusión***

- *El operador `UNION` es útil para combinar resultados de subconsultas y se usa en SQL para obtener un conjunto unificado de datos, eliminando o conservando duplicados según sea necesario.*

### ***Visualización de Joins con Diagramas de Venn***

---

### **¿Qué es un diagrama de Venn y para qué se usa en SQL?**

- *Un **diagrama de Venn** es una representación visual que muestra la relación entre conjuntos mediante círculos que se superponen. En el contexto de SQL y los **Joins**, estos diagramas ayudan a ilustrar cómo las filas de diferentes tablas se combinan de acuerdo con la condición de unión especificada.*

**En SQL, cada tipo de Join puede visualizarse con un diagrama de Venn:**

- **Inner Join:** *Muestra solo los elementos que están en la intersección de los conjuntos (las filas que coinciden en ambas tablas).*
- **Left Join:** *Incluye todas las filas del conjunto de la izquierda (tabla izquierda) y las filas coincidentes del conjunto derecho. Si no hay coincidencia en el conjunto derecho, el valor se representa como `NULL`.*
- **Right Join:** *Similar al Left Join, pero incluye todas las filas del conjunto derecho y las coincidencias del conjunto izquierdo. En SQLite, se puede simular intercambiando las tablas y usando un `LEFT JOIN`.*
- **Full Outer Join:** *Representa todos los elementos de ambos conjuntos, llenando con `NULL` los datos faltantes donde no hay coincidencias. Aunque SQLite no lo admite, se puede simular con `UNION`.*

- *En resumen, los diagramas de Venn en SQL ayudan a entender rápidamente qué datos se incluirán o excluirán en el resultado del Join.*

- **Las imágenes ayudan a visualizar cómo funcionan los distintos tipos de joins:**
